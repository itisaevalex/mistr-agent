# Chat Persistence Implementation

This document explains how chat persistence was implemented in the Mistral MCP Adapter UI, along with the integration of Python-based MCP servers.

## Overview

The Mistral MCP Adapter UI initially had no persistence layer for chat messages. Conversations were stored only in memory using a `Map` object in the `McpAdapter` class. We've enhanced the application to properly save and load chat conversations using browser localStorage.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Conversation Storage Utility

We created a dedicated module at `lib/storage/conversation-storage.ts` that handles all aspects of conversation persistence:

- **Message Storage**: Saves entire conversation histories to localStorage
- **Metadata Management**: Stores metadata about conversations (titles, timestamps, message counts)
- **Conversation Management**: Functions for listing, loading, and deleting conversations

The utility provides these key functions:

```typescript
// Save messages for a conversation
saveConversationMessages(conversationId: string, messages: ConversationMessage[]): void

// Load messages for a conversation
loadConversationMessages(conversationId: string): ConversationMessage[]

// Get all saved conversations with metadata
getSavedConversations(): ConversationMetadata[]

// Delete a conversation
deleteConversation(conversationId: string): void
```

### 2. UI Integration

We updated the main UI component in `app/page.tsx` to:

1. **Load and display saved conversations**:
   - Added a sidebar section that shows all saved conversations
   - Implemented ability to click on a conversation to load it
   - Added delete functionality for conversations

2. **Auto-save conversations**:
   - Added an effect hook that saves messages whenever they change
   - Updates metadata including conversation title based on first message

3. **Conversation Management**:
   - Enhanced the "New Chat" button to properly start fresh conversations
   - Added UI to toggle between showing and hiding saved conversations

## Storage Schema

The localStorage keys are structured as follows:

- `mistral-ui-conversations`: Array of conversation IDs
- `conversation-{id}`: JSON string of conversation messages
- `conversation-meta-{id}`: JSON string of conversation metadata

The metadata structure includes:
```typescript
interface ConversationMetadata {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  lastUpdated: number; // timestamp
  messageCount: number;
}
```

## Testing

To test the chat persistence:

1. Start a new conversation
2. Send a few messages
3. Refresh the page - your conversation should remain
4. Click "Show Saved Chats" to see all your conversations
5. Click on different conversations to switch between them
6. Try deleting a conversation

## Git Repository Setup

We've also set up a Git repository to track changes to the project. The repository is initialized with:

1. **`.gitignore` file**: Configured to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, and environment files
2. **Initialization script**: `init-git-repo.bat` batch file that initializes the repository

### Using the Git Repository

To start using the Git repository:

1. Run the initialization script:
   ```
   init-git-repo.bat
   ```

2. Add a remote repository URL:
   ```
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   ```

3. Push your changes:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Known Limitations

1. **Storage Limits**: localStorage has a maximum size limit (usually 5-10MB) which may be reached with many conversations
2. **No Server Backup**: Conversations are only stored in the browser and not synced to a server
3. **Single Device**: Conversations cannot be accessed across different devices or browsers

## Future Improvements

1. **Database Storage**: Implement a proper database for persistent storage
2. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts to associate conversations with specific users
3. **Cross-Device Sync**: Enable accessing conversations from multiple devices
4. **Export/Import**: Add functionality to export and import conversations
5. **Search**: Implement conversation search functionality

## Conclusion

The implementation of chat persistence significantly improves the usability of the Mistral MCP Adapter UI by allowing users to maintain context across sessions and manage multiple conversations. Combined with the Python MCP server integration, this creates a powerful interface for interacting with AI assistants and their tools.
